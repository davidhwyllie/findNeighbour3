# Demonstrations of server functioning

Three sets of code/data for demonstration of server function are available:

[Using real data from M. tuberculosis](demos_real.md) using ~ 100, 1000 and 7000+ size datasets.  
[Simulations addressing performance of the MixPORE algorithm](demos-simulated.md)  
[Simulations designed to stress the server to determine performance limits](demos_technical.md)
